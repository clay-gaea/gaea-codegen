# gaea-codegen

## Introduction
### Why start this project
Codegen is a great idea, that can help us build our team of code specifications, taking screenshots of our tedious and repetitive work.
But when you use procedures, there are a lot of areas that need to be customized, and I was just helpless and desperate when I used MUSTACHE.
Based on Codegen basics, I reimplemented it using Themeleaf template technology, which made me look forward to the future.

### What did the project do
This project is a simple example of generating a dependency package for a PHP project, with a lot of customization as needed.

### More I want
I have a few more ideas, but I do not have time to realize them all. Let me list them out and hope to realize them in the future.
- To achieve similar Swagger -editor, can be more than one online editing
- For OSA documents that can be wired to a repository, it can be edited, saved, Shared, simulated requests, tested, monitored
    - Maybe you want to share the OSA directly with others
    - Maybe you just want to share your OSA rendered documents with others
- Based on custom code
    - JsonSchema, yes automated testing is possible
    - Online monitoring and early warning of interfaces
    - Log standardization
    - Abnormal standardization
    - More diversified modes of communication between services
    - Packaging test release monitoring is smoother

Here's a Demo to help you understand what gaea-codegen does.
